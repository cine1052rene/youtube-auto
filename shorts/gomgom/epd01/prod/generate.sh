GOM="Gomgom, a small round cream-colored needle-felted wool bear with soft fuzzy texture, small round ears with pale pink inner ears, bright round black bead eyes, a small dark brown nose, soft pink blush on the cheeks and a gentle warm smile with no teeth ever visible, wearing a small coral pink felt heart badge on its chest and a tiny brown felt satchel bag across its body"
KONG="Kong, a tiny round yellow needle-felted baby chick with a small orange beak and one small green bean sprout with two round leaves on top of its head, Kong is tiny, its whole round body no bigger than Gomgom's head"
OWL="Grandpa Owl, a kind old round grey-brown felt owl with a cream chest, fluffy white eyebrows and small round spectacles, wearing a mustard knitted cardigan, Grandpa Owl is slightly taller than Gomgom, about a quarter head taller, never shorter than Gomgom and never twice as big"
SIZE="scale rule: Gomgom is the size reference, a palm-sized needle-felted doll about three heads tall, Grandpa Owl is slightly taller than Gomgom, other animal friends are about as tall as Gomgom, Kong is always the smallest character with its round body only as big as Gomgom's head"
STYLE="richly detailed handmade miniature world filling the whole background with layered foreground, midground and background full of cute tiny handmade props, never a plain empty wall or empty backdrop, soft warm golden light, gentle depth of field that keeps the detailed background readable, cozy warm pastel palette, handmade felt, knit, wood and ceramic textures, high quality 3D animated film render, cinematic composition, vertical 9:16, warm and cozy mood, no text, no letters"
VTAIL="the bear mouth may open softly but no teeth are ever visible, every character keeps exactly the same needle-felted wool texture, proportions, colors, accessories and body size from the first frame to the last and never turns into a cartoon or 2D character, nobody grows or shrinks during the shot, Kong stays tiny, smooth cinematic camera motion with a clear change of viewpoint, warm cozy mood, soft warm light, no text"
